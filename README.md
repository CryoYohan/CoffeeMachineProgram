# CoffeeMachineProgram
A simple virtual coffee machine program that takes coins such as quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies and calculate all of the coins. If the coins are enough for the coffee flavor's price, the virtual coffee machine will print the chosen coffee and also print the change of the money if there are any excess coins, else the coins will be refunded
